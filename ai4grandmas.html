            Deep learning is a branch of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain
            called artificial neural networks. Some of the deep learning architectures are Deep neural networks, deep
            belief networks, recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks
            <br>
            <br>
            Artificial Intelligence can be defined as a program that can sense, reason, act and adapt.
            Machine learning, generally means algorithms whose performance improve as they are exposed to more data over
            time.
            Deep learning is subset of machine learning in which multi-layered neural networks learn from vast amounts
            of data.

            Deep learning is an artificial intelligence function that imitates the workings of the human brain in
            processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making. Deep learning is a subset of machine
            learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that
            is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as deep neural learning or deep neural network.
